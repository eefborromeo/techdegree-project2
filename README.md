This is my submission for Project 2: Responsive Layout. I received an Exceeds Expectations grade for this project.

For this project, I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout demonstrates a responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.
